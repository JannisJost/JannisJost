# Hey ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Science student living in Switzerland.  I have a keen interest for coding, and I am willing to learn more about it, especially different coding languages and about the science behind computers. It has been 4 years since I started coding. I am always open and interested to learn from my own mistakes and further improve my skills.

# My Projects

Recently started to learn React Native to create useful and modern mobile applications which facilitate everyday life.
