# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I am a computer science student who really likes to code. I mainly use Java to create my own applications. I started to code two years ago and really want to improve my skills even more and also expand my knowledge on different coding languages and computers in general.

# My Projects

I like writing modern looking applications with Java/JavaFX
